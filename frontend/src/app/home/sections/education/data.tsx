    title: "Enhancing Portfolio Performance Through Multi-Agent AI: Alternative Data Integration and Real-Time Optimization",
    degree: "PhD in Engineering",
    field: "Universidad Nacional de Colombia",
    status: "In Progress",
    abstract: `
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The landscape of portfolio management is undergoing a transformative shift driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and the proliferation of alternative data sources. While traditional financial metrics remain foundational, the integration of real-time supply chain dynamics, social media sentiment, and news analytics presents unprecedented opportunities for sophisticated investment decision-making.
        <br /><br />
        This document proposes to develop a novel multi-agent AI architecture designed to coordinate specialized agents that process distinct data streams: real-time supply chain indicators (including supplier health and logistics disruptions), social media information, news analytics, and traditional financial data.
        <br /><br />
        The proposed study aims to investigate how these agents can collaboratively optimize dynamic portfolio rebalancing while maintaining robust risk management frameworks. The research will evaluate the system's performance over a 12-month period, comparing outcomes against both conventional portfolio management approaches and contemporary single-agent AI solutions, with a focus on risk-adjusted returns and downside protection.
