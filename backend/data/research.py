Title: Lean manufacturing and sustainable performance: Trends and future challenges
Journal: Journal of Cleaner Production

Abstract: Lean manufacturing has proven its positive effects on operational and economic performance in
multiple cases. However, growing consciousness regarding sustainability and the Triple Bottom Line
Share Cite approach requires an integral performance based on three main goals: economic growth,
environmental preservation, and social responsibility. Given the relevance that lean manufacturing
has acquired, it is important to understand its effects on sustainability. Thus, this paper presents a
literature review, discussing the most relevant findings of research in this sphere, and identifying
current trends concerning the effect of lean manufacturing on sustainable performance. A total of 69
papers were reviewed, following a five-step synthesis methodology. Common and contrasting results
were categorized according to each pillar of the triple bottom line, which allowed for the
identification of not only growing research trends, but also of knowledge gaps. Unlike previous
literature reviews, this study approaches lean manufacturing's effect on performance from a
multidimensional point of view, accounting for all three triple bottom line pillars. It contributes on the
identification of the main current research trends, which favors branches: one which supports
complementary interactions between lean manufacturing and all three pillars of the triple bottom
line, and the other, which evidences trade-offs among them. According to the results of the review,
knowledge gaps on the matter remain, which require further research.



Title: A social performance metrics framework for sustainable manufacturing

Abstract: Manufacturing companies are under constant pressure from stakeholders to achieve higher sustainability
levels, especially in terms of environmental and social aspects. Although social performance is not a new
topic in operations management, it is the least explored pillar of the triple bottom-line approach. Metrics
for the assessment of social performance levels remain scarce, which limits those companies that are
willing to involve them in decision-making processes. This situation can be attributed to the difficulty of
finding sufficiently comparable, widespread, and quantifiable social metrics. Therefore, the present study
aims to provide a broader perspective of social performance, including both internal and external metrics.
With the goal of providing a more holistic performance assessment, and based on findings present in the
current literature, a social performance metrics framework is proposed. The framework proposes a threelayer approach, which allows companies to strengthen their social performance evaluation, based on
internal metrics, while dealing with more complex external metrics.

Abstract: Journal Link: Synchronization between production scheduling and real demand is
an issue of great concern for production practitioners and academics.
Put in a nutshell, the solution requires the placement of a decoupling
point in order to get a trade-off between efficiency and flexibility. In the
context of a postponement production strategy, a decoupling point is an
inventory buffer to create independence between the process and final
demand. Upstream of the decoupling point, the process is managed under
a make-to-stock approach; in contrast, downstream operations meet the
final demand under a make-to-order approach. In this sense, the present
paper proposes a multicriteria methodology to locate decoupling points
in manufacturing systems. The methodology consists of two stages, with
two and three steps respectively. In the first stage, the decision criteria and
alternative for decoupling points are chosen. In the second one, the final
decoupling point placement is determined. By applying the methodology
in a metalworking company, the location of the decoupling points for nine
production lines was obtained.
